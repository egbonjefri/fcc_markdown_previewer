## Welcome to my React Markdown Previewer!



#### This is a capstone project for the freeCodeCamp Front-End Libraries course...


###### **Visit a live demo of the app [here](https://fccmarkdown-previewer.netlify.app/)**

As an example, to preview code, enter a single line of code between 2 back ticks like this: `<div></div>` 

For multi-line code, wrap your code between three back ticks in the following manner:

```
// this is multi-line code:

function anotherExample(firstLine, lastLine) {
  if (firstLine == ``` && lastLine == ```) {
    return multiLineCode;
  }
}
```
You can also make your text **bold**... whoa!
Or _italic_.
Or... wait for it... **_both!_**
And feel free to go crazy ~~crossing stuff out~~.

[Links](https://egbonjefri.github.io/) can be entered like so, and

> Block Quotes! are created like this.

And if you want to get really crazy, even tables:

Wild Header | Crazy Header | Another Header?
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Your content can | be here, and it | can be here....
And here. | Okay. | I think we get it.



1. And there are numbered lists too.
1. Use just 1s if you want!
1. And last but not least, let's not forget embedded images:
